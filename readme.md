Video - What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side, outside of a web browser. This enables developers to use JavaScript to write server-side scripts, allowing for server-side and networking applications to be built with JavaScript. 

Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and well-suited for building scalable and real-time applications. It has a large ecosystem of open-source libraries and packages, making it a popular choice for web development.

In a nutshell, Node.js extends the use of JavaScript from the browser to the server, allowing developers to use a single programming language (JavaScript) for both client-side and server-side development.
